jacal (1b7-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * jacal.sh: Find .init files in proper subdirectory of slib library location.
   (Closes: #401030)
    
  * jacal.sh: Look for "guile-1.6" and not guile; likewise make the usage
    statement say to request "guile-1.6" if that's what you want.
  * debian/control (Depends): Require guile-1.6 and not just any guile.
    [These changes are further required for jacal to work right with guile.]
