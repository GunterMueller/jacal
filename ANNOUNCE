This message announces the availability of JACAL release jacal1b8.

JACAL is an interactive symbolic mathematics program.  JACAL can
manipulate and simplify equations, scalars, vectors, and matrices of
single and multiple valued algebraic expressions containing numbers,
variables, radicals, and algebraic differential, and holonomic
functions.

JACAL is written in Scheme and works with Scheme implementations which
support the SLIB Scheme Library.  The SCM Scheme implementation
(written in C) is available with JACAL.  SCM runs on Amiga, Atari-ST,
MacOS, MS-DOS, OS/2, NOS/VE, Unicos, VMS, Windows, Unix and similar
systems.

JACAL is free software.  It is released under the GNU Public License
(GPL).

Documentation and distributions in several formats are linked from
JACAL's home page:

Links to distributions of JACAL and related softwares are at the end
