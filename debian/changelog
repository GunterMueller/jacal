jacal (1b8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/control (Depends): Require version 3a5-1 or slib; that's the first

    jacal.sh closing bug 401030 is no longer needed.
    
  * jacal.1: Repeat change from 1b7-1.
  
  * jacal.sh: Repeat second change from 1b7-2.

   (Closes: #401030)
    
  * jacal.sh: Look for "guile-1.6" and not guile; likewise make the usage
    statement say to request "guile-1.6" if that's what you want.
  * debian/control (Depends): Require guile-1.6 and not just any guile.
    [These changes are further required for jacal to work right with guile.]
